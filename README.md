### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹
blog:[[https://note.kingcwt.top/blog  ](https://note.kingcwt.top/)](https://note.kingcwt.top/)
I'm a front-end developer who turns coffee into code and bugs into features. ðŸš€âœ¨    

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on making the web a better place, one pixel at a time.   
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning how to balance perfect designs with practical implementation.    
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how I survived JavaScript's quirks and came out stronger.
